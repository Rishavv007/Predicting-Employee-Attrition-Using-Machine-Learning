# Employee Attrition Prediction with Ensemble Learning, Data Augmentation, and Explainability

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics dataset. The pipeline encompasses data preprocessing, individual model training, and a stacking ensemble for improved predictive performance. In addition, CTGAN-based data augmentation is used to enrich the training data, and SHAP is applied for model explainability.

## Overview

The pipeline begins by loading the dataset, removing unnecessary columns, and splitting the data into features and the target ("Attrition"). Categorical features are converted to a numerical format via one-hot encoding to ensure compatibility with the models.

Multiple individual models are trained, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and CatBoost. Their performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC. These models are then combined into a stacking ensemble—with Logistic Regression serving as the meta-learner—to leverage the strengths of each base model.

To address data scarcity and improve robustness, CTGAN is employed for data augmentation. The training data is combined with synthetic samples generated by CTGAN (with categorical columns explicitly converted to strings), and the stacking ensemble is retrained on this augmented data. Performance improvements are then measured.

Finally, model interpretability is achieved using SHAP. A SHAP explainer is created based on the stacking ensemble’s probability predictions, and a summary plot is generated to visualize feature importance and the contribution of each variable to the predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the dataset and applies one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
- **Model Training:** Implements multiple individual classifiers and a stacking ensemble.
- **Evaluation:** Provides performance metrics and visualizations (accuracy bar charts, ROC curves, confusion matrix).
- **Data Augmentation:** Uses CTGAN to generate synthetic data and augment the training set.
- **Explainability:** Leverages SHAP to offer insights into feature contributions.
